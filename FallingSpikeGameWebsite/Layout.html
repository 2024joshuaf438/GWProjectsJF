<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Game</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">The layout is actually a lot larger and more detailed than the home screen, which is why it's going to be split between the actual layout of the game and the event sheet, which has all the code in it. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">As you can see above the game actually looks quite simple, there is a small player at the bottom and one spike at the top. The spikes that fall after the first spike all come from that spike. Then there's the little character, whose name is Billy. Billy has to dodge the spikes and can only be controlled by the mouse. On the right there is the game over screen, this obiously would come on once Billy is hit by a spike. There is no lives system, one hit and you're done. </p>
