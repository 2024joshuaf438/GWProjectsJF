<h1 style="text-align:center;">How to play the game.</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">The game is quite simple. Unlike the first game where you control the player with WASD, in DTS you control the player using the mouse, dragging him around to prevent him from being hit. There is technical "end" to the game, the spikes will just keep falling until the player dies. You can challenge your friends to get a better score than you and a real challenge would be to somehow stay live long enough to make it to the end of the song. That would be crazy</p>
